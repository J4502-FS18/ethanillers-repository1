				<p>A day in the life of a general assignment reporter is very different each day, although some aspects are very similar.</p>

				<p>A typical day starts with pitching story ideas to an assignment editor. Afterwards, the assignment editor will pick a story for me to pursue. I then have to make necessary phone calls and do necessary research to help prepare me in the field. </p>

				<p>Once I'm out on assignment, I shoot footage for my story (known as b-roll). I then have to shoot my interview and make sure I ask good questions. Once I have everything done, I head back to the station. This is when the grind begins.</p>

				<p>The first thing I do is consolidate my clips I shot; this means I put the clips on the server. While that's happening, I begin writing a story for the website. Once the web story is done and the clips are uploaded onto the server, I then write scripts for the 5 and 6 p.m. newscats. Once the scripts are approved, I go edit my video to match what I've written. Once the video is chekced, I transfer it to the sevrer so the directors can air it on television. Once the 5 and 6 shows are over, we have a post show meeting where we critique the newscast and look for areas to improve on. Once that's over, I write a different verison of my story for the 9 and 10 p.m. newscasts.</p>

				<p>Wednesday morning, I have to work the desk from 8 a.m. to noon. My job is to answer the newsroom phone and to keep track of competition, as well as help reporters check out equipment.</p>

				<p>Along with this, I'm also making phone calls to sources for potential stories for my Thursday morning shift.</p>

				<p>When a source agrees to talk to me, I leave the desk at noon and go and get my footage and shoot my interview. It's basically another daily shift for me. I also found out getting people to talk to me is incredibly difficult.</p>

				<p>Once I get back to the station, I have to go back and get a webstory done, as well as scripts and video. I then head home and get as much sleep as I can.</p>

				<p>My alarm for Thursday morning goes off at 1:30 a.m.</p>

				<p>Once I drag myself out of bed, I go to the station and get my work done. I check over everything and make sure everything is in place. My cameraman and I then head out to the location where I'm going to broadcast live from.</p>

				<p>The morning show begins at 4:30 a.m. and I have five live shots to do. The weather is usually cold, so I dress accordingly.</p>

				<p>Once I get back to station around 7 a.m. or so, I get my webstory apporved and I do a different version of my story for the noon show. I then go home, head to class, and then take a long nap.</p>

				<p>Enterprises are also a big part of this profession.</p>

				<p>Enterprises are basically stories that don't have to be told on a particular day and time. Rather, they are stories that are long-form.</p>

				<p>I typically meet with sources well before the enterprise due date as enterprises typically take two or so weeks to finish. Interviews are done on different days usually, and the whole project is very time-consuming.</p>

				<p>Once an enterpise is finished, you must inform your news director where he/she can find it in the server and when it is supposed to air.</p>
